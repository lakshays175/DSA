1. Take a input number and store into a another variable called temp.
2. Initialize a variable to find the count of the input number with zero
3. Use loop till the input number is not equal to zero.
4. Divide the input number by 10 and increase the count variable by 1.
5. Run another loop till the length not equal to zero
6. Take another variable to store the the result.
7. Divide the temp variable with 10 to the power of length -1 and store that into the result.
8. take the modulus of temp with 10 to the power o length-1.
9. Decreament length by 1.  
10. Print the result.
