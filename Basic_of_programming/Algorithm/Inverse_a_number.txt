1. Take input of number which you want to inverse.
2. Take a variable store result and also a variable to store the original digit of the number.
3. Use loop till the input number is not equal to zero.
3. Take modulus of the input number by 10 and stored in the orginal digit and take another variable orginal place and increase it by 1.
4. Take two other variables inverse digit and inverse place, in inverse digit store orginal place and in orginal place store inverse digit.
5. Take a id multiply it by 10 to the power of inverse place minus 1 and store into a variable and add inverse number to it.
6. put this in inverse number all together. 
7. keep on dividing the input number by 10.
