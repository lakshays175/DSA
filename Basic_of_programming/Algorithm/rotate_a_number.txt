1. Take input of number and then input with how much you want to rotate.
2. Take a input of number and store into the temp variable and take a count variable.
3. Use loop till the input number is not equal to zero.
3. Divide the input number by 10 and increase the count variable by 1.
4. As the second input can also be negative, we have to add the count variable to the second input.
5. Take a temp variable and take modulus with the 10 to the power of second input and store into a variable i.e number1.
6. Take a temp variable and divide it to the 10 to the power of second input and store into a variable i.e number2.
7. Take 10 to the power of count variable - second input and store into a variable i.e number3.
8. Take another variable to store result which will be equal to the number1 multiply by number3 and adding into number 2.
