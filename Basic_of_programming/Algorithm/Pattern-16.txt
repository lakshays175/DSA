1. Take the input number.
2. Take the spaces (2*n-3) and stars as equal to 1.
3. Take a loop start it from i equal to 1 till n and take another variable val into it and intialise it with 1.
4. Take another loop start it from 1 till stars,print the val inside it and increase it by 1.
5. Take another loop start it from 1 till spaces,print the space.
6. if the i is equal to n then decrease stars by 1 and val also by 1 because it has one extra at the end  and even the val is also increased by 1.
7. Take another loop start it from 1 till spaces,print the space.
8. Take another loop start it from 1 till stars,decrease the val and print the val again.
